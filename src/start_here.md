First of all, credit goes to [u/CorySama](https://www.reddit.com/user/CorySama/) and [u/Better_Pirate_7823](https://www.reddit.com/user/Better_Pirate_7823/) for most of this, I am mostly just copy-pasting from them.
If all goes well, we can Sticky this for everyone to see.

The main thing you need to know is [“Smart”](https://fgiesen.wordpress.com/2016/02/05/smart) by [Fabian “ryg” Giesen](https://fgiesen.wordpress.com/)


OpenGL is a good API to start with. There's a lot to learn regardless of which API you use. Once you can do an animated character in a scene with lighting, shadows, particles and basic full-screen post processing, you'll know how to proceed forward on your own from there.
